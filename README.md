# CHIP8
Full instruction-level emulator for the CHIP-8 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

Code features an emulator that fully supports all instructions featured in the CHIP-8 ISA.
The code in the main branch uses OPENGL libraries to display the CHIP8 graphics output. The code in the terminal branch uses a Unix terminal for graphics output, and does not use any external graphics libraries.

To run, please run make from src/. After doing so, the compiled emulator binary (under src/build) can be launched by specifying a CHIP-8 binary/ROM file as the second parameter.

Developed, compiled, and tested on MacOS.
